# sample webpage

A static webpage inspired from Google's home page. 
Just trying to put together whatever I have learned so far.
I wanted to use grids but did not. I think I rely too heavily on them.
The webpage I have created is not really responsive.  
I have refrained from using pixels. I have used rems for everything.
